#the dictionary data type 

# Indexes for dictionaries are called keys, and
 a key with its associated value is called a key-value pair. 

>>> myCat = {'size': 'fat', 'color': 'gray', 'disposition': 'loud'}
>>> myCat['size'] 
'fat' 
>>> 'My cat has ' + myCat['color'] + ' fur.' 
'My cat has gray fur.'


#Dictionaries can still use integer values as keys,
 just like lists use integers for indexes,
 but they do not have to start at 0 and can be any number.

>>> spam = {12345: 'Luggage Combination', 42: 'The Answer'}
